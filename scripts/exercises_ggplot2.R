## 1. Read in sampledata.tsv


## 2. Explore the dataset


# Save each of following plot in the plots folder
## 3. Plot the amount of males and females in this study using a bar plot


## 4. Do the same but show the nationality and flip the axes 


## 5. Create a boxplot showing the age distribution of each nationality. 
## Use the fill or colour aesthetic to make it a little bit more colorful


## 6. Add an extra layer to 5. with plotting points over the boxplot. 
## Remove that layer again and explore the difference with geom_jitter()

## 7. Make a density plot of the age distribution coloured by gender, 
## faceted by nationality.
## Extra: try one plot per row, and use a transparency of 0.5, 
## you can also add geom_rug()


# Well done!
